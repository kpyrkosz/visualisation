# Visualisation of alogrithm on graphs

C++/OpenGL program I wrote couple of years ago. In short, it allows to randomize or draw a graph and then run a selected algorithm on it (Dijksta, Kruskal etc.). Built and tested on windows and linux, does not contain any platform specific code. Required third party libs: glfw, glew, glm. The main goal was to make addition of new algorithm easy, which boils down to implementing one interface.
